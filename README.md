# Features
The quiz features multiple features to enhance user-interaction and repeat quiz attempts:

&#10004; Correct answer counter immediately tells you every time you get a question correct! A 'Yes, that's correct' or 'Sorry, that's incorrect' message appears above the counter as well.

&#10004; Timer starts at 60 seconds and the game ends when the time is over. Deducts 10 seconds for each correct answer

&#10004; Your score and option to save your initials (with the score) appears on the results page. There is a start again option once the quiz is over, to try again for a better score! The score and timer reset.

&#10004; High contrast backgrounds and texts, along with clear large font, make for an easy to view page.

&#10004; Share your score or invite a friend by clicking the mobile friendly button!

## Summary
This was a big challenge as a new developer. By pseudocoding my project, using javascript, along with HTML, and CSS, I've created a beautiful quiz. I hope it reflects my love for all things Bachelor/Bachelorette. I wanted the functionality to be top notch as well as provide interesting quiz content about the show and its contestants.
