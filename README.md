## Project Description
This quiz is a fun way to learn some new interesting facts about the Bachelor and Bachelorette franchises. You can save your high score, along with your initals and then try again for a better score.

>I worked a lot on the storage to get the high score to correctly display at the end, but it still isn't quite where I want it to be. The console does show the correct count, but I have some debugging to do on the myScore and highScore functions.
>I also intend to optimize the buttons and line spacing for smaller screens.
>The correct answer will display after an incorrect answer is chosen. Est date of completion is 12/31/2021.

# Features
The quiz features multiple features to enhance user-interaction and repeat quiz attempts:

&#10004; Correct answer counter immediately tells you every time you get a question correct!

&#10004; Timer starts at 60 seconds and the game ends when the time is over

&#10004; Your score and option to save your initials (with the score) appears on the results page. There is a button right below to start the quiz over for a better score! The score and timer reset.

&#10004; High contrast backgrounds and texts, along with clear large font, make for an easy to view page.

## Summary
This was a big challenge as a new developer. By pseudocoding my project, using javascript, along with HTML, and CSS, I've created a beautiful quiz. I hope it reflects my love for all things Bachelor/Bachelorette. I wanted the functionality to be top notch as well as provide interesting quiz content about the show and its contestants. I intend to fix the three issues listed above (and presented in GitHub) for an even better user-experience.
